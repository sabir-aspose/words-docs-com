Document translation is a frequently needed option in the age of high digitalization. Aspose.Words supports document translation using *Google* generative language models, which allows developers to translate texts content into more than 300 languages.

Use the [Translate](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/iaimodeltext/#translate-com.aspose.words.Document-int) method to translate your documents into any language represented in the [Language](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/language/) enumeration. Note that if the source document contains several languages, the Google AI-based model will be able to translate all supported languages. If the model cannot recognize the language in some text fragments, then you will be returned a document with these untranslated fragments and with the rest of the text translated.

The following code example shows how to use the *Gemini 1.5 Flash* model in Aspose.Words to translate a document into Arabic:

{{< highlight java >}}
Document doc = new Document("Document.docx");

String apiKey = System.getenv("API_KEY");
 IAiModelText model = (IAiModelText)AiModel.create(AiModelType.GEMINI_15_FLASH).withApiKey(apiKey);

Document translatedDoc = model.translate(doc, Language.ARABIC);
translatedDoc.save("AI.AiTranslate.docx");
{{< /highlight >}}

Translating documents with Aspose.Words saves time and makes it easy to integrate translation functionality into your projects. For more information, check the [Java API documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/).

## FAQ

1. **Q:** Do I need a Google API key to use the translation feature?  
   **A:** Yes. The translation functionality relies on Google generative models, so you must provide a valid API key when creating the `AiModel` instance.

2. **Q:** Which languages can I translate to?  
   **A:** Any language listed in the `Language` enumeration (over 300 languages) is supported. Use `Language.<LANGUAGE>` to specify the target language.

3. **Q:** Can I translate only a part of a document, such as a single section?  
   **A:** The `translate` method works on the whole `Document` object. To translate a specific part, extract that part into a separate `Document`, translate it, and then replace the original content.

4. **Q:** What happens if the source document contains multiple languages?  
   **A:** The model attempts to detect and translate each language it recognizes. Segments in unsupported or unrecognizable languages remain unchanged in the output document.

5. **Q:** Can I choose a different AI model for translation?  
   **A:** Yes. When creating the model, use `AiModel.create(AiModelType.<MODEL>)` with any supported model type (e.g., `GEMINI_15_FLASH`, `GEMINI_1_0_PRO`). The chosen model determines translation quality and speed.
