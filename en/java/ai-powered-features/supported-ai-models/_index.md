Aspose.Words now leverages advanced AI models to enhance document processing and analysis. With the Aspose.Words.AI namespace, developers can access AI-powered features such as document summarization and analysis, document translation, and grammar checking by integrating generative language models from industry leaders.

## Supported Model Types

Aspose.Words library currently supports integration with:

* OpenAI,
* Google,
* and Claude models' families.

These models bring powerful capabilities for working with documents. By enabling seamless interaction with these AI tools, Aspose.Words simplifies complex tasks and enhances productivity for developers.

The full list of supported model types is listed in the [AiModelType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/aimodeltype/) enumeration.

You can create a model instance using the [Create](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/aimodel/#create-int) method of the [AiModel](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/aimodel/) class.

The following code example shows how to create a new instance of **AiModel** class:

{{< highlight java>}}
public static AiModel create(int modelType)
{{< /highlight >}}

## Using Self-hosted LLM Implementations

With Aspose.Words, developers can also integrate self-hosted LLMs (Large Language Models), providing an alternative to OpenAI/Anthropic/Google's hosted services.

The following code example shows how to create a self-hosted LLM based on OpenAI's generative language model:

{{< highlight java >}}
public void selfHostedModel() throws Exception
{
    Document doc = new Document(getMyDir() + "Big document.docx");

    String apiKey = System.getenv("API_KEY");
    // Use OpenAI generative language models.
    AiModel model = new CustomAiModel().withApiKey(apiKey);

    Document translatedDoc = model.translate(doc, Language.RUSSIAN);
    translatedDoc.save(getArtifactsDir() + "AI.SelfHostedModel.docx");
    }

// Custom self-hosted AI model.
static class CustomAiModel extends OpenAiModel
{
    protected String getUrl()
    {
        return "https://localhost/";
    }

    protected String getName()
    {
        return "my-model-24b";
    }
}

## FAQ

1. **Q:** Which AI model families are supported by Aspose.Words for Java?  
   **A:** Aspose.Words for Java supports models from OpenAI, Google (Gemini), and Anthropic’s Claude families. The supported models are listed in the `AiModelType` enumeration.

2. **Q:** How do I create an `AiModel` instance for a specific model type?  
   **A:** Use the static `AiModel.create(int modelType)` method, passing the integer value from the `AiModelType` enum that corresponds to the desired model (e.g., `AiModelType.GPT_4O`). The method returns an `AiModel` object ready for translation, summarization, etc.

3. **Q:** Can I use a self‑hosted LLM with Aspose.Words?  
   **A:** Yes. Derive a class from the appropriate base model (e.g., `OpenAiModel`) and override `getUrl()` and `getName()` to point to your self‑hosted endpoint. Instantiate your custom class and use it like any other `AiModel`.

4. **Q:** Do I need a separate license to use AI features in Aspose.Words?  
   **A:** No additional license is required. AI capabilities are included with a regular Aspose.Words for Java license. Ensure your license file is loaded correctly using `License license = new License(); license.setLicense("Aspose.Words.Java.lic");`.

5. **Q:** How can I find the integer value for a specific `AiModelType` enumeration member?  
   **A:** In Java, you can call `AiModelType.GPT_4O.getValue()` (or simply refer to the constant’s name) to obtain its underlying integer value, which you then pass to `AiModel.create`. This value is also documented in the API reference.
