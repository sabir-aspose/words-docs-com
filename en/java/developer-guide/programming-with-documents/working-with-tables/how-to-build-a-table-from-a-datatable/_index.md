## Purpose Summary

This page explains how to build a table from a DataTable using Aspose.Words.

{{% /alert %}}

Often your application will pull data from a database and store it in the form of a **DataTable**. You can easily insert this data into your document as a new table and quickly apply formatting to the whole table.

Note that the preferred way of inserting data from a **DataTable** into a document table is by using [Mail Merge with Regions](/words/java/mail-merge-and-reporting/#aboutmailmerge-mailmergewithregionsexplained). The technique presented in this article is only suggested if you are unable to create a suitable template before hand to merge data with, in other words if you require everything to happen programmatically.

Using Aspose.Words, you can easily retrieve data from a database and store it as a table:

1. Create a new **DocumentBuilder** object on your **Document**.
1. Start a new table using **DocumentBuilder**.
1. If we want to insert the names of each of the columns from our **DataTable** as a header row then iterate through each data column and write the column names into a row in the table.
1. Iterate through each **DataRow** in the **DataTable**:
   1. Iterate through each object in the **DataRow**.
   1. Insert the object into the document using **DocumentBuilder**. The method used depends on the type of the object being inserted e.g **DocumentBuilder.Writeln** for text and **DocumentBuilder.InsertImage** for a byte array which represents an image.
   1. At the end of processing of the **DataRow** also end the row being created by the **DocumentBuilder** by using **DocumentBuilder.EndRow**.
1. Once all rows from the **DataTable** have been processed finish the table by calling **DocumentBuilder.EndTable**.
1. Finally we can set the desired table style using one of the appropriate table properties such as **Table.StyleIdentifier** to automatically apply formatting to the entire table.

The **ImportTableFromDataTable** method accepts a **DocumentBuilder** object, the **DataTable** containing the data and a flag which specifies if the column heading from the **DataTable** are included at the top of the table. This method builds a table from these parameters using the builder's current position and formatting. Provides a method to import data from the `DataTable` and insert it into a new table using the DocumentBuilder.

The following data in our **DataTable** is used in this example:

The following code example shows how to execute the above algorithm in Aspose.Words:

The method can then be easily called using your **DocumentBuilder** and data.

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How can I insert an image stored as a byte array into a table cell?  
   **A:** Use `DocumentBuilder.insertImage(byte[] imageBytes)` while the builder's cursor is positioned inside the desired cell. After inserting the image you may call `DocumentBuilder.endRow()` to continue with the next cell.

2. **Q:** What is the easiest way to apply a predefined table style after the table is built?  
   **A:** Retrieve the `Table` node (the first child of the builder's current paragraph) and call `table.setStyleIdentifier(StyleIdentifier.LIGHT_LIST)` (or any other `StyleIdentifier`). The style is applied to the whole table instantly.

3. **Q:** Is there a more automatic approach than writing code for each column when populating a table from a `DataTable`?  
   **A:** Yes. Aspose.Words' **Mail Merge with Regions** can map a `DataTable` directly to a table in a template. Create a region in the template (`<<TableStart:Data>> … <<TableEnd:Data>>`) and call `document.getMailMerge().executeWithRegions(dataTable)`. This eliminates manual iteration.

4. **Q:** How should I handle `null` values in the `DataTable` while building the table?  
   **A:** Check each cell value before writing. If the value is `null`, write an empty string or a placeholder, e.g. `builder.writeln("")`. This prevents `NullPointerException` and keeps the table layout consistent.

5. **Q:** Can I merge cells or set column widths after the table has been created?  
   **A:** Yes. After `endTable()`, locate the `Table` node, then use `Cell.merge(Cell other)` to merge cells horizontally or vertically. Column widths can be set via `Table.getFirstRow().getCells().get(i).getCellFormat().setWidth(width)`. Adjust widths before saving the document.
