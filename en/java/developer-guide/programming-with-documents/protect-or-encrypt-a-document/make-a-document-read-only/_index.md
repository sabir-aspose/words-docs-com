Sometimes, you may have a document that needs a review, but you do not want reviewers to randomly modify your content. Aspose.Words allows you to make the permission of your document read-only so that the content can be copied or read, but not modified. This will prevent content from being removed or added to your document.

Applying the read-only option to your document does not prevent someone from creating a new copy of it and saving it with another name.

This article explains how to make a document read-only.

## How to Make a Document Read-Only

Aspose.Words has the public class [WriteProtection](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/writeprotection/) that specifies write protection settings for a document. You do not create instances of this class directly.

Write protection shows whether the author has recommended opening a document as read-only and/or requiring a password to modify the document.

Aspose.Words allows you to make a document read-only to restrict editing by using the [ReadOnlyRecommended](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/writeprotection/#getReadOnlyRecommended) property and the [SetPassword](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/writeprotection/#setPassword-java.lang.String) method.

In Microsoft Word, you can create a Read-Only document in a similar way using both:

* “Always Open Read-Only” (File → Info → Protect Document)
* "Password to modify" (Save As → Tools → General Options → Password)

{{% /alert %}}

Users can also restrict document editing by selecting [ProtectionType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/protectiontype/) as **ReadOnly**, but this is another feature that provides more advanced protection capabilities. There is such a function in Microsoft Word, respectively, it is implemented in Aspose.Words.

**ProtectionType** will be described in detail in one of the following articles – “Restrict Document Editing”.

{{% /alert %}}

The **ReadOnlyRecommended** property is password-secured, so if you do not set a password before applying the **ReadOnlyRecommended** property, then other users can simply open the document as if it were unprotected. You access the document protection settings and set a write protection password via the **SetPassword** method.

Note that the password being set is just a property in a document that can be removed if the document properties are accessed. Accordingly, such a password is not a guarantee of the document security.

If you need to check if a document has a write protection password that restricts it from editing, you can use the [IsWriteProtected](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/writeprotection/#isWriteProtected) property.

The following code example shows how to make a document read-only:

## Remove Read-Only Restriction

If you do not want a user to open your document as read-only, you can simply set the **ReadOnlyRecommened** property to *false* or select **ProtectionType** as **NoProtection**.

The following code example shows how to remove read-only access for a document:

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How do I make a document read‑only with Aspose.Words for Java?  
   **A:** Load the document, obtain its `WriteProtection` object via `document.getProtection()`, set `setReadOnlyRecommended(true)`, optionally call `setPassword("yourPassword")`, and then save the document. The `ReadOnlyRecommended` flag tells Word to open the file in read‑only mode.

2. **Q:** Can I require a password to modify the document while still allowing read‑only access?  
   **A:** Yes. After enabling `ReadOnlyRecommended`, call `writeProtection.setPassword("modifyPassword")`. Users can open the file without a password, but any attempt to edit will prompt for the password you supplied.

3. **Q:** How can I verify whether a document is write‑protected?  
   **A:** Use the `WriteProtection` object's `isWriteProtected()` property. It returns `true` if a password has been set or if `ReadOnlyRecommended` is enabled.

4. **Q:** How do I remove the read‑only recommendation or any write protection from a document?  
   **A:** Set `writeProtection.setReadOnlyRecommended(false)` and optionally `writeProtection.setPassword(null)`. You can also change the protection type to `ProtectionType.NO_PROTECTION` before saving. This restores normal editing capabilities.
