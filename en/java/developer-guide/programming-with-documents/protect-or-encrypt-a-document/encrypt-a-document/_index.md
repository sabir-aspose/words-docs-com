## Purpose Summary

This page describes how to encrypt Word documents using passwords and various encryption algorithms.

{{% /alert %}}

Encryption is the process that translates readable text to meaningless sequences of bytes so it can only be read by the person who has the decryption key or the secret code. This process plays an important role in securing your content. It helps to encode the content, verify the origin of a document, prove that the content has not been modified after it was sent, and ensure that the data from the document is safe.

This article explains how Aspose.Words allows you to encrypt a document and how to check if a document has encryption or not.

## Encrypt with Password

To encrypt a document, use the **Password** property to provide a password that functions as an encryption key. This will modify the content of your document and make it unreadable. The encrypted document will require to have this password entered before it can be opened.

You can find the appropriate **Password** property for the required format. Each document save format in the [Password](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/docsaveoptions/#getPassword) has a corresponding class containing save options for this format. For example, the [DocSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/docsaveoptions/) property in the [Password](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/ooxmlsaveoptions/#getPassword) class for DOC, or the [Password](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/ooxmlsaveoptions/#getPassword) property in the [OoxmlSaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/ooxmlsaveoptions/) class for DOCX, DOCM, DOTX, DOTM, and FlatOpc.

Note that only certain document formats support encryption. For example, RTF does not support encryption.

The table below lists the formats and encryption algorithms supported by Aspose.Words:

| Format | Supported Encryption while Loading                          | Supported Encryption while Saving            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| DOC, DOT                                                     | XOR encryption40-bit RC4 EncryptionCryptoAPI RC4 Encryption | RC4 Encryption (40-bit)                      |
| DOCX, DOTX, DOCM, DOTM, FlatOPC, FlatOpcTemplate, FlatOpcMacroEnabled, FlatOpcTemplateMacroEnabled | ECMA-376 Standard EncryptionECMA-376 Agile Encryption       | ECMA-376 Standard Encryption (AES128 + SHA1) |

The following code example shows how to encrypt a document with a password:

## Check If a Document Is Encrypted

In some cases, you may have an unreadable document and want to be sure that the document is encrypted and not corrupted or compressed.

To detect if a document is encrypted and if a password is required, you can use the [IsEncrypted](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/fileformatinfo/#isEncrypted) property of the [FileFormatInfo](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/fileformatinfo/) class. This property will also allow you to perform some action before loading a document, for example, informing a user to provide a password.

The following code example shows how to detect the document encryption:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "821ff3a1df0c75b2af641299b393fb60" "verify-encrypted-document.java" >}}

## Open a Document With or Without a Password

When we have made sure that a document is encrypted, we can try to open this document without a password, which should lead to an exception.

The following code example shows how to try opening an encrypted document without a password:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "821ff3a1df0c75b2af641299b393fb60" "load-encrypted-document-without-password.java" >}}

After we have seen that an encrypted document cannot be opened without a password, we can try to open it by entering the password.

The following code example shows how to try opening an encrypted document with a password:

## Limitations and Considerations

This section covers specific constraints and important considerations for document encryption using Aspose.Words:

- **Encryption is write-only**: Once a document is loaded and then saved with encryption, the original unencrypted content is no longer retained in memory. There is no way to extract or retrieve the original plaintext from an encrypted document in Aspose.Words.

- **Encryption algorithm selection**: Aspose.Words does not expose a direct property to choose the encryption algorithm. The algorithm used depends on the output format and save options:
  - For DOC: RC4 40-bit.
  - For DOCX/DOTX/DOCM/DOTM/FlatOPC: ECMA-376 Standard Encryption using AES128 + SHA1.
  - For ODT/OTT: ODF Encryption using AES256 + SHA256.
  - For PDF: RC4 40-bit or 128-bit, depending on save options.

- **Password policies are not enforced**: Aspose.Words does not validate or enforce password strength or complexity. It is the application developer's responsibility to enforce appropriate password policies if required.

- **Encryption header compatibility**: While Aspose.Words supports decrypting documents created by other tools (e.g., Microsoft Word) if the correct password is known, encryption compatibility is guaranteed only for documents created with Aspose.Words. interoperability with third-party implementations may vary.

- **No encryption support for all formats**: Not all document formats support encryption. Examples of unsupported formats include RTF, HTML, MHTML, and image formats.

- **Password protection applies only to saving**: Setting a password in save options does not protect an already-loaded document from being modified or saved again without encryption. Each `Save` call must explicitly include encrypted save options to ensure protection.

- **No support for multiple encryption layers**: Aspose.Words does not support applying multiple encryption layers to the same document. Over-encryption (e.g., encrypting an already encrypted document) requires re-saving with a new password and will use the algorithm defined for the output format.

- **Loading encrypted documents with invalid password**: When loading an encrypted document using `Document` constructor with an incorrect password, Aspose.Words throws an `IncorrectPasswordException`. Applications should handle this exception to provide appropriate user feedback.

- **FlatOpc variants**: FlatOpc, FlatOpcTemplate, FlatOpcMacroEnabled, and FlatOpcTemplateMacroEnabled formats use the same encryption mechanism as DOCX (ECMA-376 Standard), but they are not editable in all word processors without conversion to the native DOCX structure.

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How do I encrypt a Word document with a password using Aspose.Words for Java?  
   **A:** Use the appropriate save options class for the target format (e.g., `DocSaveOptions` for DOC or `OoxmlSaveOptions` for DOCX) and set its `setPassword("yourPassword")` method before calling `Document.save`. The document will be saved encrypted and will require the password to open.

2. **Q:** Which file formats support encryption when saving with Aspose.Words for Java?  
   **A:** DOC, DOCX, DOCM, DOTX, DOTM, FlatOPC, ODT, OTT, and PDF support encryption. Formats such as RTF do **not** support encryption. Each format uses its own set of supported algorithms (e.g., RC4 for DOC, ECMA‑376 AES128 for DOCX, AES256 for ODT, RC4 for PDF).

3. **Q:** How can I determine whether a document is encrypted before loading it?  
   **A:** Create a `FileFormatInfo` instance by calling `FileFormatUtil.detectFileFormat(filePath)`. Then check the `isEncrypted()` property. If it returns `true`, the document is encrypted and you must supply the password when loading.

4. **Q:** What exception is thrown if I try to open an encrypted document without providing a password?  
   **A:** Aspose.Words throws a `IncorrectPasswordException`. Catch this exception to prompt the user for the correct password or to handle the error gracefully.

5. **Q:** Can I choose a different encryption algorithm for a specific format?  
   **A:** Yes. Each save options class exposes algorithm‑specific properties (e.g., `setEncryptionAlgorithm(EncryptionAlgorithm.AES256)` for ODT or `setEncryptionAlgorithm(EncryptionAlgorithm.RC4_128)` for PDF). Set the desired algorithm before saving the document.
