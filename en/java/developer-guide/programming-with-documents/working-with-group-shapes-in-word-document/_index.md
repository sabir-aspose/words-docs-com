{{% /alert %}}

Sometimes you need to add a group shape into a Word document. Such a group shape consists of multiple shapes.

In Microsoft Word, you can quickly add a group shape using the Group command/button. An individual shape in a group can be moved separately.

In Aspose.Words it is very easy to add a group shape using the [GroupShape](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/groupshape/) class. **Shape** is created separately using the [Shape](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/shape/) class and then added to the [GroupShape](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/groupshape/) object using the [AppendChild](https://reference.aspose.com/words/java/com.aspose.words/compositenode/#appendChild-com.aspose.words.Node) method.

The following code example shows how to add a group shape into a Word document:
