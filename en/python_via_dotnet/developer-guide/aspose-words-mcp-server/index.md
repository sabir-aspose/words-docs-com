*Purpose Summary. What is this page about?*

This page explains how to install, configure, and run the Aspose.Words MCP Server, which exposes Aspose.Words for Python via .NET functionality as Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools, and outlines its features, supported transports, licensing requirements, and integration options.

{{% /alert %}}

Aspose.Words MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server built on top of [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](/words/python-net/). It automates Microsoft Word document creation and editing and exposes operations as MCP tools that any MCP‑compatible client can call.

You can check out the [Aspose.Words MCP Server GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspose-words/Aspose.Words-MCP-Server).

Supported transports: `stdio`, `streamable-http`, `sse`.

## How to Install Aspose.Words MCP Server

To install Aspose.Words MCP Server via pip, run the following:

```bash
pip install aspose-words-mcp
```

To install Aspose.Words MCP Server from source, run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aspose-words/Aspose.Words-MCP-Server
cd Aspose.Words-MCP-Server
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run Aspose.Words MCP Server

After installation, use this CLI command:

```bash
aspose-words-mcp
```

Without installation, run the following:

```bash
python mcp_server.py
```

By default, the server runs with the `stdio` transport.

{{% alert color="primary" %}}

Supported transports and environment variables:

- `MCP_TRANSPORT` — `stdio` | `streamable-http` | `sse` (default `stdio`)
- `MCP_HOST` — host address (default `0.0.0.0`)
- `MCP_PORT` — port (default `8080`)
- `MCP_PATH` — HTTP path for `streamable-http` (default `/mcp`)
- `MCP_SSE_PATH` — events path for `sse` (default `/sse`)
- `LOG_LEVEL` — logging level (`INFO`, `DEBUG`, ...)

{{% /alert %}}

HTTP/SSE example:

```bash
export MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http   # or sse
export MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0
export MCP_PORT=8080
export MCP_PATH=/mcp                   # for streamable-http
export MCP_SSE_PATH=/sse               # for sse
aspose-words-mcp
```

On start, the server prints the listening address.

## Aspose.Words License

The Aspose.Words license is applied on server startup. The path is resolved with the following precedence:

1. `license_path` argument of `run_server(..., license_path=None)`
2. `ASPOSE_WORDS_LICENSE_PATH` environment variable

The following code example shows how to apply the license:

```bash
export ASPOSE_WORDS_LICENSE_PATH='/path/to/aspose.words.lic'
```

{{% alert color="primary" %}}

This package is MIT‑licensed, but it depends on Aspose.Words for Python via .NET, which is a proprietary product. You must obtain a valid Aspose.Words license to use it beyond evaluation limitations. See [Aspose.Words for Python via .NET](/words/python-net/) and [purchase options](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy/words/python).

If no license is provided or the file is not accessible, the server runs in Evaluation mode.

## Integration Capabilities

Aspose.Words MCP Server supports the following integration options:

- **Claude Desktop MCP**: add this server with `streamable-http` or `sse` transport and the URL printed by the server at startup.
- **Any MCP (JSON) clients**: configure the matching transport and path.

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How do I apply an Aspose.Words license to the MCP server?  
   **A:** Set the `ASPOSE_WORDS_LICENSE_PATH` environment variable to the full path of your `.lic` file before starting the server, or pass the path via the `license_path` argument of `run_server(...)`. The server will load the license on startup; if the file is missing or invalid, it runs in evaluation mode.

2. **Q:** How can I change the transport used by the MCP server?  
   **A:** Define the `MCP_TRANSPORT` environment variable with one of the supported values: `stdio`, `streamable-http`, or `sse`. The server reads this variable at launch and configures the corresponding transport automatically.

3. **Q:** How do I run the MCP server on a custom host and port?  
   **A:** Use the `MCP_HOST` and `MCP_PORT` environment variables to specify the desired address and port, e.g., `export MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1` and `export MCP_PORT=9090` before starting the server.

4. **Q:** What should I do if the server fails to start because the license is reported as invalid?  
   **A:** Verify that the license file is a valid Aspose.Words for Python via .NET license (not an Aspose.Total.NET.lic file), ensure the path is correct, and confirm that the license matches the product version. If the license is correct, restart the server; otherwise, the server will operate in evaluation mode.

5. **Q:** Can I use an Aspose.Total.NET.lic file with the MCP server for Python?  
   **A:** No. The MCP server requires a license specifically for Aspose.Words for Python via .NET. An Aspose.Total.NET.lic does not cover this product, so you need to obtain a separate Aspose.Words license.
