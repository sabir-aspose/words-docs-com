Sometimes users need to apply custom formatting to fields. In this article, we will look at a couple of examples of how this can be done.

To learn more options, see the full list of properties for each field type in the corresponding class in the [Fields module](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.fields/).

## How to Apply Custom Formatting to Field Result

Aspose.Words provides API for custom formatting of field's result. You can implement [IFieldResultFormatter](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.fields/ifieldresultformatter/) interface to control how the field result is formatted. You can apply numeric format switch, i.e. \# "#.##", date/time format switch, i.e. \@ "dd.MM.yyyy", and number format switch, i.e. \* Ordinal.

The following code example shows how to apply custom formatting for the field result:

## How to evaluate `IF` condition

If you want to evaluate `IF` condition after mail merge, you can use the [EvaluateCondition](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.fields/fieldif/evaluate_condition/) method that immediately returns the result of the expression evaluation.

The following code example shows how to use this method:
