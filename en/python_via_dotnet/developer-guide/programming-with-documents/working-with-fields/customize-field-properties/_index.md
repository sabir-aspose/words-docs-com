*Purpose Summary. What is this page about?*

This page demonstrates how to modify field properties—such as renaming MERGEFIELDs or changing AUTHOR field attributes—and retrieve a field's display result using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET, with concrete code examples.
{{% /alert %}}

Aspose.Words provides the ability to programmatically interact with various field properties. In this article, we will look at a couple of examples so that you understand the basic principle of working with field properties. You can see the full list of properties for each field type in the corresponding class in the [Fields module](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.fields/).

## Field Property Update

Sometimes users need to change the value of a field property. For example, update the [author_name](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.fields/fieldauthor/author_name/) property of the `AUTHOR` field or change the [field_name](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.fields/fieldmergefield/field_name/) property of the `MERGEFIELD` field.

The following code example shows how to rename merge fields in a Word document:

## Field Display Result

Aspose.Words provides a property to obtain the field's result for fields that do not have a field separator node. We call this "fake result" or display result; MS Word displays it in the document by calculating the field's value on the fly, but there is no such value in the document model.

The following code example shows the usage of [display_result](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.fields/field/display_result/) property:

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How can I rename a `MERGEFIELD` in a Word document using Python?  
   **A:** Load the document, iterate through its fields, cast each `FieldMergeField` and set the `field_name` property to the new name. After updating, save the document. Example:

   ```python
   import aspose.words as aw

   doc = aw.Document("input.docx")
   for field in doc.range.fields:
       if isinstance(field, aw.fields.FieldMergeField):
           merge_field = aw.fields.FieldMergeField(field)
           merge_field.field_name = "NewFieldName"
   doc.save("output.docx")
   ```

2. **Q:** How do I retrieve the display result of a field that has no separator node?  
   **A:** Use the `display_result` property of the `Field` object. It returns the value that Word would show for the field even when the field result is not stored in the document.

   ```python
   import aspose.words as aw

   doc = aw.Document("input.docx")
   for field in doc.range.fields:
       print(f"Field type: {field.type}, Display result: {field.display_result}")
   ```

3. **Q:** Can I change the author name of an `AUTHOR` field programmatically?  
   **A:** Yes. Cast the field to `FieldAuthor` and set its `author_name` property, then save the document.

   ```python
   import aspose.words as aw

   doc = aw.Document("input.docx")
   for field in doc.range.fields:
       if isinstance(field, aw.fields.FieldAuthor):
           author_field = aw.fields.FieldAuthor(field)
           author_field.author_name = "John Doe"
   doc.save("output.docx")
   ```

4. **Q:** How can I determine whether a field contains a separator node?  
   **A:** The `has_separator` property of a `Field` indicates the presence of a separator. It returns `True` if the field has a separator node, otherwise `False`.

   ```python
   import aspose.words as aw

   doc = aw.Document("input.docx")
   for field in doc.range.fields:
       print(f"Field type: {field.type}, Has separator: {field.has_separator}")
   ```

5. **Q:** Is it possible to list all available properties for a specific field type?  
   **A:** Yes. Each field type has a dedicated class in the `aspose.words.fields` namespace. You can refer to the documentation for that class (e.g., `FieldMergeField`, `FieldAuthor`) to see all its properties and methods. In code, you can use `dir()` on an instance to inspect available members.

   ```python
   import aspose.words as aw

   merge_field = aw.fields.FieldMergeField()
   print(dir(merge_field))   # Shows all properties and methods of FieldMergeField
   ```
