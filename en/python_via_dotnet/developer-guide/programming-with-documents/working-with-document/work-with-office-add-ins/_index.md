*Purpose Summary. What is this page about?*

This page explains how to use Aspose.Words for Python via .NET to create and manage Office Add‑ins, specifically task‑pane web extensions, with examples of adding, listing, and customizing task panes via the WebExtension and TaskPane classes.

{{% /alert %}}

Sometimes you might want to give access to interface controls that run code to modify documents. Aspose.Words API provides the [webextensions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.webextensions/) module, which grants various classes to customize elements and attributes extending the XML vocabulary for representing Office Add-ins.

WebExtensions namespace can be conditionally divided into:

* Objects for working with the task pane
* Objects for working with web extensions

## Using Task Panes

The task panes are interface surfaces that are displayed on the right side of the window in Microsoft Word. Task pane allows users to access interface controls that can run code to modify documents.

For example, using Aspose.Words API, you can add a task pane add-in and customize its appearance.

## Using Web Extensions

Web Extensions are tools that expand the capabilities of Office applications and interact with Office document content. Web Extensions provide additional functionality to Office clients for improving user experience.

Aspose.Words provides the ability to add Web Extensions of the Task Pane type using the [WebExtension](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.webextensions/webextension/) and [TaskPane](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words.webextensions/taskpane/) classes, and also allows you to customize the pane and extension properties.

The following code example shows how to create task panes and add to web extension task panes with basic properties:

To see a list of task pane add‑ins, use the [web_extension_task_panes](https://reference.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose.words/document/web_extension_task_panes/) property.

The following code example shows how to get such a list of add‑ins:

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How do I add a task‑pane web extension to a document using Aspose.Words for Python via .NET?  
   **A:** Create a `WebExtension` object, add a `TaskPane` to its `TaskPanes` collection, set the required properties (e.g., `Id`, `Title`, `Visible`), and then add the `WebExtension` to the document’s `WebExtensionList`. Finally, save the document.

2. **Q:** How can I retrieve the list of task‑pane add‑ins that are already attached to a document?  
   **A:** Use the `Document.web_extension_task_panes` property, which returns a collection of `TaskPane` objects. You can iterate over this collection to inspect each add‑in’s properties such as `Id` and `Title`.

3. **Q:** Is it possible to modify the properties of an existing task‑pane after it has been added?  
   **A:** Yes. After obtaining the `TaskPane` instance from the document’s `web_extension_task_panes` collection, you can change properties like `Title`, `Visible`, or `DockState`. The changes are persisted when the document is saved.

4. **Q:** Are there any limits on the number of task‑pane web extensions that can be added to a single Word document?  
   **A:** Aspose.Words does not impose a hard limit on the number of task‑pane extensions. The practical limit is determined by Word’s own constraints and the size of the document’s XML, so adding a reasonable number of panes is safe.

5. **Q:** How do I remove a specific task‑pane web extension from a document?  
   **A:** Locate the desired `TaskPane` in the `Document.web_extension_task_panes` collection and call `RemoveAt(index)` or `Remove(taskPane)` on the collection. After removal, save the document to persist the change.
