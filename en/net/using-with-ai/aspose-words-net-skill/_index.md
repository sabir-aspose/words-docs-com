**Tip for AI tools**

If you are using an AI coding assistant, point it to the `SKILL.md` file first.  
This file acts as the entry point and helps the model discover the rest of the documentation structure.

## Quick Start

1. Download the Aspose.Words for .NET Skill package:

    <p id="api-button-id"><a href="/aspose-words-net-skill.zip" class="api-button"><strong>⬇ Download</strong> | aspose-words-net-skill.zip</a></p>

2. Extract the content of archive into `skills` folder (generally, it is `.agents/skills/`)
3. Place the extracted folder inside your coding agent knowledge directory.
4. Make sure the tool loads **SKILL.md** as the entry point.
   The agent will automatically discover additional documentation through the `/references/` directory.
5. Try the Aspose.Words for .NET Skill – just write in your coding agent:

   `/Aspose.Words for .NET Convert mydocument.docx to pdf`

   or
   
   `Use Aspose.Words for .NET skill to convert mydocument.docx to pdf`

   The generated code should look similar to this:
   ```
   using Aspose.Words.Loading;
   using Aspose.Words.Saving;

   Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "Document.docx");
   doc.Save("DocToDocx.pdf");
   ```

Most tools only need the main **SKILL.md** file as the entry point, while the additional Markdown files provide detailed documentation sections.

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How is the Aspose.Words for .NET Skill different from the official documentation?
   **A:** The Aspose.Words for .NET Skill is generated from the official documentation but is organized specifically for AI coding assistants and large language models. It provides a structured entry point through SKILL.md and links to focused reference files, making it easier for AI tools to retrieve relevant information and generate more accurate code examples. Developers can still use the official documentation directly, while AI assistants benefit from the optimized structure of the skill package.
2. **Q:** Do I need all the Markdown files, or is SKILL.md enough?
   **A:** SKILL.md serves as the entry point for the skill and is typically the first file an AI coding assistant loads. From there, the assistant can discover the additional Markdown files in the references directory, which provide detailed guidance for specific topics such as document conversion, mail merge, digital signatures, and AI-powered features. For the best results, install the complete skill package rather than using only a single file.
3. **Q:** Which AI coding assistants support the Aspose.Words for .NET Skill?
   **A:** The Aspose.Words for .NET Skill is designed for AI tools that support Markdown-based skills or knowledge packages. Examples include Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Codex, Windsurf, OpenCode, and other compatible coding assistants. Because the skill consists of standard Markdown files, it can also be adapted for other AI tools that allow custom documentation or knowledge sources.
