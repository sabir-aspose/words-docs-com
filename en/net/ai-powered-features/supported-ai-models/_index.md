*Purpose Summary. What is this page about?*

This page explains which AI models Aspose.Words supports for document tasks.

{{% /alert %}}

Aspose.Words now leverages advanced AI models to enhance document processing and analysis. With the Aspose.Words.AI namespace, developers can access AI‑powered features such as document summarization and analysis, document translation, and grammar checking by integrating generative language models from industry leaders.

## Supported Model Types

Aspose.Words library currently supports integration with:

* OpenAI,
* Google,
* and Claude models' families.

These models bring powerful capabilities for working with documents. By enabling seamless interaction with these AI tools, Aspose.Words simplifies complex tasks and enhances productivity for developers.

The full list of supported model types is listed in the [AiModelType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.ai/aimodeltype/) enumeration.

{{% /alert %}}

You can create a model instance using the [Create](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.ai/aimodel/create/) method of the [AiModel](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.ai/aimodel/) class. 

The following code example shows how to create a new instance of **AiModel** class:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public static AiModel Create(AiModelType modelType)
{{< /highlight >}}

## Using Self-hosted LLM Implementations

With Aspose.Words, developers can also integrate self-hosted LLMs (Large Language Models), providing an alternative to OpenAI/Anthropic/Google's hosted services.

The following code example shows how to create a self‑hosted LLM based on OpenAI's generative language model:

{{< highlight csharp >}}
public void SelfHostedModel()
{
    Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "Big document.docx");

    string apiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("API_KEY");
    // Use OpenAI generative language models.
    AiModel model = new CustomAiModel().WithApiKey(apiKey);

    Document translatedDoc = model.Translate(doc, Language.Russian);
    translatedDoc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "AI.SelfHostedModel.docx");
}

// Custom self-hosted AI model.
internal class CustomAiModel : OpenAiModel
{
    protected override string Url
    {
        get { return "https://localhost/"; }
    }

    protected override string Name
    {
        get { return "my-model-24b"; }
    }
}

## FAQ

1. **Q:** Which AI model providers are supported by Aspose.Words?  
   **A:** Aspose.Words supports models from OpenAI, Google (Gemini), and Anthropic’s Claude families. The supported models are exposed through the `AiModelType` enumeration, allowing you to select the desired provider and version.

2. **Q:** How do I create an instance of a specific AI model, such as GPT‑4o?  
   **A:** Use the static `AiModel.Create` method and pass the corresponding `AiModelType` value. For example:  

   ```csharp
   AiModel gpt4o = AiModel.Create(AiModelType.OpenAi_Gpt4o);
   ```

   The returned `AiModel` object can then be used for summarization, translation, or other AI‑driven operations.

3. **Q:** Can I integrate a self‑hosted LLM with Aspose.Words?  
   **A:** Yes. Derive a class from the appropriate provider base class (e.g., `OpenAiModel`) and override the `Url` and `Name` properties to point to your local endpoint. Instantiate your custom class and use it like any other `AiModel`.
