## Purpose Summary

This page explains how to output sequential data such as lists or tables using template syntax.

{{% /alert %}}

You can output a sequence of elements of the same type to your report using a data band. A *data band* has a body that represents a template for a single element of such a sequence. While building a report, sequence elements are enumerated, and the following procedure takes place for each of the elements:

1. The data band body is duplicated and appended to the report.
1. The appended data band body is populated with the element’s data.

**Note** – A data band body can contain nested data bands.

A data band body is defined between the corresponding opening and closing `foreach` tags within a template as follows.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
  <<foreach ...>>
  data_band_body
  <</foreach>>
{{< /highlight >}}

You can reference an element of the corresponding sequence in template expressions within a data band body using an iteration variable. At runtime, an *iteration variable* represents a sequence element for which an iteration is currently being performed. You can declare an iteration variable within the corresponding opening `foreach` tag.

An opening `foreach` tag defines a `foreach` statement enclosed by brackets. The following table describes the elements of this statement.

<table class="outputting-sequential-data">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
      <td><strong>Element</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Optional?</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Remarks</strong></td>
		</tr>
    <tr>
			<td>Iteration Variable Type</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><p>You can specify the type of an iteration variable explicitly. This type must be known by the engine (see “Setting up Known External Types” for more information).</p><p>If you do not specify the type explicitly, it is determined implicitly by the engine depending on the type of the corresponding sequence.</p></td>
		</tr>
    <tr>
			<td>Iteration Variable Name</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td><p>You can specify the name of an iteration variable to use it while accessing the variable’s members. The name must be unique within the scope of the corresponding foreach tag.</p><p>If you do not specify the name, you can access the variable’s members using the contextual object member access syntax (see “Using Contextual Object Member Access” for more information).</p></td>
		</tr>
    <tr>
			<td>“in” Keyword</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td> </td>
		</tr>
    <tr>
			<td>Sequence Expression</td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td>A sequence expression must return an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.ienumerable?view=net-6.0">IEnumerable implementor</a>.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

The complete syntax of a `foreach` tag (including optional elements) is as follows.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
<<foreach [variable_type variable_name in sequence_expression]>>
data_band_body
<</foreach>>
{{< /highlight >}}

## FAQ

1. **Q:** Do I have to specify the iteration variable type in a `foreach` tag?  
   **A:** No. The type is optional. If you omit it, the engine infers the type from the sequence you provide. Specify the type only when you need the engine to recognize a custom or external type.

2. **Q:** How can I access the members of the iteration variable without giving it a name?  
   **A:** When you omit the variable name, you can use the contextual object member access syntax, e.g., `{{Field}}`, to refer directly to the current element’s members inside the data band.

3. **Q:** Is it possible to place a data band inside another data band?  
   **A:** Yes. Data band bodies may contain nested `foreach` tags, allowing you to output hierarchical data such as master‑detail relationships.

4. **Q:** How do I force the engine to skip to the next item before the current data band body finishes?  
   **A:** Use the `<<break>>` tag inside the data band body. When the engine encounters this tag, it stops processing the current iteration and moves to the next element in the sequence.

5. **Q:** What kind of expression can I use after the `in` keyword?  
   **A:** The expression must evaluate to an object that implements `IEnumerable`. Typical examples are collections like `List<T>`, arrays, or any custom enumerable type that the engine can iterate over.
