*What is this page about?*

This page explains how to insert bookmarks dynamically in reporting templates.

{{% /alert %}}

You can insert bookmarks to your reports dynamically using `bookmark` tags. Syntax of a `bookmark` tag is defined as follows.

{{< highlight csharp >}}
<<bookmark [bookmark_expression]>>
bookmarked_content
<</bookmark>>
{{< /highlight >}}

Here, `bookmark_expression` defines the name of a bookmark to be inserted during runtime. This expression is mandatory and must return a non‑empty value. While building a report, `bookmark_expression` is evaluated and its result is used to construct a bookmark start and end that replace corresponding opening and closing `bookmark` tags respectively.

**Note** – A `bookmark` tag cannot be used within a chart.

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How do I define the name of a bookmark dynamically?  
   **A:** Place an expression that evaluates to the desired bookmark name inside the `bookmark` tag, e.g., `<<bookmark [Customer.Id]>>`. At runtime the expression is evaluated and the resulting string becomes the bookmark name.

2. **Q:** Can I use the `bookmark` tag inside a table, list, or other container elements?  
   **A:** Yes. The `bookmark` tag works inside tables, lists, paragraphs, and most other document elements. The only restriction is that it cannot be placed inside a chart.

3. **Q:** What happens if the bookmark expression returns an empty string or null?  
   **A:** The tag is ignored and no bookmark is created. Because the expression must return a non‑empty value, an empty result will cause the engine to skip the bookmark insertion without raising an error.

4. **Q:** How can I reference a bookmark that was created dynamically later in the same report?  
   **A:** Use the standard Aspose.Words field syntax, such as a `REF` field: `<<field REF [bookmark_name]>>`. The `[bookmark_name]` part should match the expression used when the bookmark was created, allowing you to cross‑reference the dynamic bookmark elsewhere in the document.
