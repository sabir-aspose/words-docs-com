## Purpose Summary

This page explains the differences between the LINQ Reporting Engine and Mail Merge and helps you determine which approach fits different reporting scenarios.

{{% /alert %}}

Aspose.Words provides two solutions for automatic filling template documents with data: Mail Merge and LINQ Reporting Engine. But what is the difference between the two and which solution is better to choose? Let us make a closer look at each.

## Mail Merge Features

As well as the most of Aspose.Words features, Mail Merge mimics the Microsoft Word feature with the same name. Therefore, a typical Mail Merge template consists of common document content, merge fields to be replaced with data, and fields of other types supported by Microsoft Word defining additional logic for building a result document. For example, a Mail Merge template for an order could look as follows.

<img src="mail-merge-features.jpg" alt="mail-merge-features-aspose-words-net" style="width:850px"/>

Key features provided by Mail Merge are as follows:

- Printing and formatting data values
- Basic calculations
- Dynamic insertion of images and documents
- Support of repetitive document regions (data bands)
- Inclusion of document parts depending on conditions
- Built-in support for `ADO.NET` objects as data sources (any custom data source can be supported by implementing the [IMailMergeDataSource](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.mailmerging/imailmergedatasource/) interface)

Overall, Mail Merge is a good way to go if you are never going to use features beyond the scope of Mail Merge, or you have to deal with Microsoft Word Mail Merge templates. However, being tied with and limited by Microsoft Word behavior, Mail Merge cannot be easily extended to cover every specific scenario, and this is where LINQ Reporting Engine stands out.

## LINQ Reporting Engine Features

In contrast to Mail Merge, the concept of LINQ Reporting Engine was born within Aspose.Words and is not tied with any Microsoft Word legacy. The engine uses its own [template syntax](/words/net/template-syntax/) based on plain-text tags, which can be one of the reasons to switch to its usage if working with Microsoft Word fields is too complex for you or your users creating templates. For example, an alternative LINQ Reporting Engine template for an order looks as follows.

<img src="linq-features.jpg" alt="linq-features-aspose-words-net" style="width:850px"/>

However, the major advantage of the engine is its out-of-the-box support of many features missing in Mail Merge. The following are the key ones:

- Support of multiple data sources (including of different types)
- Built-in support of more data source types: Custom .NET objects, `ADO.NET` objects, JSON, XML, CSV
- Using of C#-based expression syntax (extended for `ADO.NET` and other data sources) directly in templates
- Using of LINQ extension methods for data manipulations directly in templates
- Dynamic building of charts
- Built-in support of HTML insertion
- Dynamic merging of table cells
- Controlling of how template syntax errors are reported

The good news is that LINQ Reporting Engine can be further extended to fulfill almost any specific need. So if you face any issue while implementing your specific requirement using the engine, please feel free to contact us at our [Free Support](https://forum.aspose.com/c/words/8) forum, and we will gladly provide you a solution based on existing features of the engine or introduce a new feature to address your need.

## FAQ

1. **Q:** When should I choose Mail Merge over the LINQ Reporting Engine?  
   **A:** Use Mail Merge if you need to work with existing Microsoft Word mail‑merge templates or require only basic field replacement, calculations, and image insertion. It is ideal when the template is created by end‑users familiar with Word's native mail‑merge feature. For more complex scenarios—multiple data sources, JSON, custom expressions, or advanced layout control—the LINQ Reporting Engine is a better fit.

2. **Q:** Can a template that contains standard Word mail‑merge fields be processed by the LINQ Reporting Engine?  
   **A:** No. The LINQ Reporting Engine uses its own plain‑text tag syntax and does not interpret Word's built‑in mail‑merge fields. If you need to reuse a Word mail‑merge template, you must either keep using Mail Merge or convert the template to the LINQ syntax.

3. **Q:** Do I need a different Aspose.Words license to use the LINQ Reporting Engine?  
   **A:** No. Both Mail Merge and the LINQ Reporting Engine are part of the same Aspose.Words for .NET library, so a single valid Aspose.Words license covers both features. Ensure the license file is loaded before creating the `Document` object, e.g., `License license = new License(); license.SetLicense("Aspose.Words.lic");`.
