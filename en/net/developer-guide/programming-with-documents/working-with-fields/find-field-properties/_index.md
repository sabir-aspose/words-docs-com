{{% alert color="grey" %}}

## Purpose Summary

This page describes how to locate field properties in a document programmatically.

{{% /alert %}}

A field that is inserted using [DocumentBuilder](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/documentbuilder/).[InsertField](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/documentbuilder/insertfield/) returns a [Field](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.fields/field/) object. This is a faсade class that provides useful methods to quickly find some properties of a field.

The following code example shows how to find the field code and field result:

Note if you are only looking for the names of merge fields in a document, then you can instead use the built-in [GetFieldNames](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.mailmerging/mailmerge/getfieldnames/) method.

The following code example shows how to get names of all merge fields in a document:
