## Purpose Summary

This page explains how to replace fields in a document programmatically.

{{% /alert %}}

Replacing fields is often required when you wish to save your document as a static copy. For example, when sending as an attachment in an e-mail. Converting fields such as `DATE` or `TIME` to static text will allow the document to display the same date as when it was sent. Also, in some situations, you may need to remove the conditional `IF` fields from your document and replace them with the most recent text result instead. For example, converting the result of the `IF` field to static text so it will no longer dynamically change its value when fields in the document are updated.

The diagram below shows how the `IF` field is stored in a document:

* the text is surrounded by the special field nodes – [FieldStart](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.fields/fieldstart/) and [FieldEnd](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.fields/fieldend)
* the [FieldSeparator](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.fields/fieldseparator/) node separates the text within the field into the field code and field result
* the field code defines the general behavior of the field, while the field result retains the most recent result when this field is updated using Microsoft Word or Aspose.Words
* the field result is what is stored in the field and displayed in the document when viewed

## Fields That Cannot be Replaced by Text

Replacing a field with static text does not work properly for some fields in a header or footer.

For example, trying to convert the `PAGE` field in a header or footer to static text will result in the same value being displayed on all pages. This is because headers and footers are repeated across multiple pages, and when they remain as fields, they are handled especially so they display the correct result for each page.

However, in the header, the `PAGE` field translates well to static run of text. This run of text will be evaluated as if it were the last page in the section, which will cause any `PAGE` field in the header to display the last page over all pages.

The following code example shows how to replace the field with its most recent result:

## Convert Certain Field Types in Specific Document Parts

Since the **ConvertFieldsToStaticText** method accepts two parameters – the [CompositeNode](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/compositenode/) properties and the [FieldType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.fields/fieldtype/) enumeration, it is possible to pass any composite node to this method. This allows fields to be converted to static text only in specific parts of the document.

For example, you can pass a [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document/) object and convert fields of the specified type from the entire document to static text, or you can pass a [Body](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/body/) object of a section and only convert the fields found in that body.

When passing a block-level node such as a [Paragraph](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/paragraph/), be aware that in some cases, fields can span across multiple paragraphs. If this happens it is recommended to pass the parent of the composite instead to avoid this.

{{% /alert %}}

The [FieldType](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.fields/fieldtype/) enumeration passed to the **ConvertFieldsToStaticText** method specifies what type of fields should be convert to static text. Any other field type found in the document will remain unchanged.

The following code example shows how to select fields of a specific type – *targetFieldType* in a specific node – *compositeNode* and then convert them to static text:

The following code example shows how to convert all `IF` fields in a document to static text:

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How can I replace all fields in a document with their current results?  
   **A:** Use the static method `FieldHelper.ConvertFieldsToStaticText(document, FieldType.Any)` where `document` is an instance of `Document`. This walks the entire document tree and replaces every field with the text stored in its field result node.

2. **Q:** I only want to replace a specific type of field, such as `IF` fields. How do I do that?  
   **A:** Pass the desired `FieldType` enumeration value to `ConvertFieldsToStaticText`. For example:  
   ```csharp
   Document doc = new Document("input.docx");
   FieldHelper.ConvertFieldsToStaticText(doc, FieldType.FieldIf);
   ```  
   This converts only `IF` fields, leaving all other fields untouched.

3. **Q:** Can I limit the conversion to a particular part of the document, like the body of a section or a single paragraph?  
   **A:** Yes. The first argument of `ConvertFieldsToStaticText` is any `CompositeNode`. Provide the node you want to process, e.g., `section.Body` or `paragraph.ParentNode`. The method will replace matching fields only within that node.

4. **Q:** Why does converting a `PAGE` field in a header to static text show the same page number on every page?  
   **A:** Header/footer fields are shared across pages. When a `PAGE` field is replaced with static text, the value is taken from the header’s context (usually the last page of the section) and applied to all pages. To keep correct page numbers, avoid converting `PAGE` fields in headers/footers, or replace them after the document is split into individual pages.

5. **Q:** My field spans multiple paragraphs and `ConvertFieldsToStaticText` throws an exception. What should I do?  
   **A:** Fields that cross paragraph boundaries should be processed at a higher level. Pass the parent node that contains the whole field (for example, the `Section` or `Body`) instead of an individual `Paragraph`. This ensures the method sees the complete field structure.
