## Purpose Summary

This page explains how to work with hyperlinks inside Word documents.

{{% /alert %}}

A hyperlink in Microsoft Word documents is the `HYPERLINK` field. In Aspose.Words, hyperlinks are implemented through the [FieldHyperlink](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words.fields/fieldhyperlink/) class.

## Insert a Hyperlink

Usethe [InsertHyperlink](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/documentbuilder/inserthyperlink/)method to insert a hyperlink into the document. This method accepts three parameters:

1. Text of the link to be displayed in the document
2. Link destination (URL or a name of a bookmark inside the document)
3. Boolean parameter that should be true if the `URL` is a name of a bookmark inside a document

The **InsertHyperlink** method always adds apostrophes at the beginning and end of the URL.

Note that you need to specify font formatting for the hyperlink display text explicitly using the `Font` property.

## Replace or Modify Hyperlinks

Hyperlink in Microsoft Word documents is a field. A field in a Word document, as we said earlier, is a complex structure consisting of multiple nodes that include field start, field code, field separator, field result and field end. Fields can be nested, contain rich content and span multiple paragraphs or sections in a document.

To replace or modify hyperlinks, it is need to find the hyperlinks in the document and replace either their text, URLs, or both.

The following code example shows how to find all hyperlinks in Word document and changes their `URL` and display name:

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How do I insert a hyperlink that points to an external URL?  
   **A:** Use `DocumentBuilder.InsertHyperlink` with the display text, the full URL (e.g., `https://www.example.com`), and set the third parameter to `false`. After insertion, you can format the link text via `builder.Font` (e.g., set `builder.Font.Color = Color.Blue; builder.Font.Underline = Underline.Single;`).

2. **Q:** How can I create a hyperlink that points to a bookmark inside the same document?  
   **A:** Pass the bookmark name as the second argument to `InsertHyperlink` and set the third argument to `true`. The method will treat the second argument as a bookmark reference rather than an external URL.

3. **Q:** What is the recommended way to change the display text of an existing hyperlink?  
   **A:** Locate the `FieldHyperlink` object, access its `Result` node (which holds the displayed text), and replace the text with the new string. After updating, you may need to re‑apply font formatting if the style should differ.

4. **Q:** How can I modify the URL of a hyperlink that is already in the document?  
   **A:** Find the `FieldHyperlink` instance, then update its `Hyperlink` property (or the field code) with the new URL string. Call `field.Update()` to refresh the field result so the change is reflected in the document.

5. **Q:** Is there a way to remove a hyperlink while keeping its display text?  
   **A:** Yes. Remove the `FieldHyperlink` node from the document tree but keep its `Result` node (the text). You can do this by extracting the `Result` node, inserting it back into the parent, and then deleting the entire field node hierarchy. This leaves the plain text in the document without the hyperlink.
