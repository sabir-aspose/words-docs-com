*What is this page about?*

This page describes how to convert DOCM documents to DOCX while preserving macros and embedded content in a compliant manner.

{{% /alert %}}

On this page we will look at how to convert a document that contains VBA code and has a .docm extension to a .docx document. With this conversion, macros and vbaProject parts stored in a document in DOCM format will not be written to the DOCX.

{{< tab tabNum="1" >}}

In Aspose.Words, we normally use the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document/document/) constructor of Aspose.Words API to load a document in DOCM format and the  [Document.Save](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document/save/#save/) method to save the document to DOCX.

The following code example shows how to convert DOCM to DOCX:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "b70165dae131a133c643d59a4ebd7441" "docm-to-docx-aspose-words.cs" >}}

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab tabNum="2" >}}

You can also do the same using the Open XML SDK. At the same time, note that it looks somewhat more complicated and more cumbersome.

The following code example modifies the specified document by verifying that the document contains a vbaProject part and removing that part. After the code removes the part, it changes the document type internally and renames the document so that it uses .docx extension.

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "b70165dae131a133c643d59a4ebd7441" "docm-to-docx-open-xml.cs" >}}
