## Purpose Summary

This page explains how to open a Word document from a stream and manage stream-based loading.

{{% /alert %}}

On this page we will look at how to load a document from a stream using Aspose.Words or Open XML SDK.

{{< nosnippet >}}

{{< tabs tabTotal="2" tabID="1" tabName1="Aspose.Words" tabName2="Open XML SDK" >}}

{{< tab tabNum="1" >}}

Simply pass a stream object that contains the document into the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/net/aspose.words/document/document/) constructor.

The following code example shows how to open a document from a stream:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "a230affc64d19e458a3a6a5452903946" "add-text-stream-aspose-words.cs" >}}

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab tabNum="2" >}}

You can also do the same using the Open XML SDK. At the same time, note that it looks somewhat more complicated and more cumbersome.

The example shown here can be used to open a Word document from an already open stream and append some text using the Open XML SDK. You can call it by passing a handle to the open stream as the first parameter and the text to add as the second. For example, the following code example opens the file in the Public Documents folder and adds text to it:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "a230affc64d19e458a3a6a5452903946" "add-text-stream-open-xml.cs" >}}

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

{{< /nosnippet >}}
