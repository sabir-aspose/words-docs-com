## FAQ

1. **Q:** How do I apply a license for Aspose.Words in a Node.js‑via‑.NET project?  
   **A:** Load the license file using the `Aspose.Words.License` class in your .NET code before creating any `Document` objects. Example:  
   ```csharp
   Aspose.Words.License license = new Aspose.Words.License();
   license.SetLicense("Aspose.Words.lic");
   ```
   Ensure the license file is deployed with your application and the path is correct.

2. **Q:** Where can I find the API reference for licensing and other classes?  
   **A:** The complete API reference for Aspose.Words for Node.js via .NET is available at https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/. Look under the **License** section for details on the `License` class and its methods.

3. **Q:** What should I include when posting a support request on the forum?  
   **A:** Attach the original document (or a zip containing all relevant files), a minimal reproducible code snippet, the exact version of Aspose.Words you are using, and a clear description of the problem. This helps the support team reproduce and resolve the issue quickly.

4. **Q:** Is phone support available for technical questions?  
   **A:** No. Aspose provides technical support exclusively through the free support forum and the issue‑tracking system. Phone support is limited to sales and purchase inquiries only.

5. **Q:** How can I verify that my license is correctly applied?  
   **A:** After setting the license, you can check the `License.IsLicensed` property (or simply attempt an operation that requires a license, such as saving a PDF). If the operation succeeds without a trial watermark or limitation message, the license is active.
