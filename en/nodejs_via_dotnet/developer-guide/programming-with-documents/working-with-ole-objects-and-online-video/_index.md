OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) is a technology by which users can work with documents containing "objects" created or edited by third-party applications. That is, OLE allows an editing application to export these "objects" to another editing application and then import them with additional content.

In this article, we will talk about inserting an OLE object and setting its properties, as well as inserting an online video into a document.

## Insert OLE Object

If you want OLE Object, call the [insertOleObject](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/documentbuilder/insertoleobject/) method and pass it the **ProgId** explicitly with other parameters.

The following code example shows how to insert OLE Object into a document:

### Insert OLE Object as an Icon

OLE objects can also be inserted into documents as images.

The following code example shows how to insert OLE Object as an icon. For this purpose, the [DocumentBuilder](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/documentbuilder/) class exposes the [insertOleObjectAsIcon](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/documentbuilder/insertoleobjectasicon/) method:

## Insert Online Video

Online video can be inserted into Word document from the *"Insert" > "Online Video"* tab. You can insert an online video into a document at the current location by calling the [insertOnlineVideo](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/documentbuilder/insertonlinevideo/) method.

The [DocumentBuilder](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/documentbuilder/) class introduces four overloads of this method. The first one works with the most popular video resources and takes the `URL` of the video as a parameter. For example, the first overload supports simple insertion of online videos from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) resources.

The following code example shows how to insert an online video from *Vimeo* into a document:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "82ca803e5833cb807b7e1c5111066cb0" "insert-online-video.js" >}}

The second overload works with all other video resources and takes embedded HTML code as a parameter. The HTML code for embedding a video may vary depending on the provider, so contact the respective provider for details.

Please note that the document will be automatically optimized for MS Word 2013 to show video.

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How do I insert an OLE object into a Word document using Node.js?  
   **A:** Use `DocumentBuilder.insertOleObject(progId, filePath, isIcon, iconFilePath, width, height)`. Provide the OLE object's ProgID (e.g., `"Word.Document"`), the source file path, and optionally specify whether to display it as an icon and its dimensions.

2. **Q:** Can I insert an OLE object as an icon instead of the full object?  
   **A:** Yes. Call `DocumentBuilder.insertOleObjectAsIcon(progId, filePath, iconFilePath, width, height)`. The method inserts the object as an image that, when double‑clicked, opens the embedded file.

3. **Q:** Which video platforms are supported by `insertOnlineVideo`?  
   **A:** The first overload of `insertOnlineVideo` directly supports YouTube and Vimeo URLs. For other platforms, use the overload that accepts raw HTML embed code.

4. **Q:** How can I control the size of an inserted online video?  
   **A:** Use the overload `insertOnlineVideo(url, width, height)` or `insertOnlineVideo(html, width, height)` to specify the desired dimensions in points.

5. **Q:** My OLE object appears as a broken link or does not display; what could be wrong?  
   **A:** Ensure the `ProgId` matches the installed application on the target machine and that the source file path is correct. If the object is inserted as an icon, verify that the icon file exists and is accessible.
