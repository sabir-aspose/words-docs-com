In Aspose.Words, [TextBox](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.drawing/textbox/) class is used to specify how a text is displayed inside a shape. It provides a public property named as [parent](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.drawing/textbox/parent/) to get the parent shape for the text box to allow customer to find linked [Shape](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.drawing/shape/) from linked [TextBox](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.drawing/textbox/).

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How can I obtain the parent `Shape` of a `TextBox`?  
   **A:** Use the `parent` property of the `TextBox` object. It returns the `Shape` that contains the textbox, allowing you to access shape‑level properties or other linked shapes.  

2. **Q:** How do I determine whether a `TextBox` is the head, middle, or tail of a linked sequence?  
   **A:** The `Shape.textBox` object exposes the boolean properties `isHead`, `isMiddle`, and `isTail`. Check these properties to know the position of the textbox within the linked chain.  

3. **Q:** What method should I call to break an existing link between two `TextBox` objects?  
   **A:** Call the `breakLink()` method on the `Shape.textBox` instance. This removes the link to the next textbox in the sequence, leaving the current textbox isolated.
