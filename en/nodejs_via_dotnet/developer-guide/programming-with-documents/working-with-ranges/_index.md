In Aspose.Words, a [Range](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/range/) is a “flat window” into an otherwise tree-like model of the document.

If you have worked with Microsoft Word Automation, you probably know that one of the main tools to examine and modify document content is the [Range](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/range/) object. [Range](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/range/) is like a "window" into the document content and formatting. Aspose.Words also has the [Range](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/range/) class and it is designed to look and act similarly to **Range** in Microsoft Word. Although **Range** cannot cover an arbitrary portion of a document and does not have a **Start** and **End**, you can access the range covered by any document node including the [Document](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/document/) itself. In other words, each node has its own range. The [Range](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/range/) object allows you to access and modify text, bookmarks and form fields within the range.

## Retrieve Plain Text

Use the [text](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/range/text/) property to retrieve plain, unformatted text of the range.

The following code example shows how to get a plain, unformatted text of a range:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "9164e9c0658006e51db723b0742c12fc" "ranges-get-text.cs" >}}

You can download the sample file of this example from [Aspose.Words GitHub](https://github.com/aspose-words/Aspose.Words-for-Node.js-via-.NET/tree/main/Data/Document.docx).

## Deleting Text

Range allows the deletion of all characters of the range by calling [delete](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/range/delete/). 

The following code example shows how to delete all characters of a range:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "9164e9c0658006e51db723b0742c12fc" "ranges-delete-text.cs" >}}
