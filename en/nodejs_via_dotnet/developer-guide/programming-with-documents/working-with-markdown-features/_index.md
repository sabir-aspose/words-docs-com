This topic discusses how to implement Markdown features using Aspose.Words. Markdown is a simple way to format plain text that can easily be converted to HTML. Aspose.Words supports the following Markdown features:

- Headings
- Blockquotes
- Horizontal rules
- Bold emphasis
- Italic emphasis

The Markdown feature implementation mostly follows the `CommonMark` specification in Aspose.Words API and all the features are represented as corresponding styles or direct formatting. Which means that

- Bold and Italic are represented as [Font.bold](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/font/bold/) and [Font.Italic](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words/font/italic/). 
- Headings are paragraphs with Heading 1 - Heading 6 styles. 
- Quotes are paragraphs with "Quote" in the style name. 
- HorizontalRule is a paragraph with HorizontalRule shape.

There are nuances of translating Markdown to the Aspose.Words Document Object Model (DOM), described in the article [Translate Markdown to Document Object Model (DOM)](/words/nodejs-net/translate-markdown-to-document-object-model/).

## Markdown Document with Emphases

This section demonstrates you how to produce a markdown document with emphases as given below:

Markdown treats asterisks (*) and underscores (_) as indicators of emphasis.
You can write **bold** or *italic* text. 
You can also write ***BoldItalic*** text.
{{< /highlight >}}

The following code snippet can be used to produce the above given markdown document.

## How to Align Content Inside the Table while Exporting into Markdown

Aspose.Words API provides [TableContentAlignment](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.saving/tablecontentalignment/) enumeration which defines alignment directions to align contents in tables while exporting into the Markdown document. The following code example demonstrates how to align content inside the table.
