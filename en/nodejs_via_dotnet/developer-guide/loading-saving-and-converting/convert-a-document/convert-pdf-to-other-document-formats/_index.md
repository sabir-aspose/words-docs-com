Aspose.Words can load even such a complex format as PDF. This opens up new opportunities: it is possible to convert PDF to Word or other formats that bring users far ahead in solving many applied problems.

## Convert PDF to Other Formats {#convert-pdf-to-other-formats}

The most popular conversion from PDF is conversion to Microsoft Word formats such as DOCX, DOC, as well as image formats such as JPG or PNG. With that said, converting a document from one format to another performs in a familiar way.

The following code example shows how to convert a document from PDF to DOCX:

## Specify Load Options when Importing PDF {#specify-load-options-when-importing-pdf}

Aspose.Words provides you with the [PdfLoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.loading/pdfloadoptions/) class, which allows more precise control over how PDF documents are loaded.

Most properties inherit or overload properties that already exist in the [LoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.loading/loadoptions/) class. In addition to them, a number of properties are specified for PDF format. For example, you can use the [pageCount](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.loading/pdfloadoptions/pagecount/) and [pageIndex](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.loading/pdfloadoptions/pageindex/) properties to define the page range to be loaded from a PDF document, and the [skipPdfImages](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.loading/pdfloadoptions/skippdfimages/) properties to control whether images should be skipped when loading PDF. Another supported parameter is the [password](https://reference.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/aspose.words.loading/loadoptions/password/), which must be provided for password-protected documents.

## Supported PDF Content {#supported-pdf-content}

* Lists
* Headers and footers
