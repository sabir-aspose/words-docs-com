Document translation is a frequently needed option in the age of high digitalization. Aspose.Words supports document translation using *Google* generative language models, which allows developers to translate texts content into more than 300 languages.

Use the [Translate](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.ai/iaimodeltext/translate/) method to translate your documents into any language represented in the [Language](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.ai/language/) enumeration. Note that if the source document contains several languages, the Google AI‑based model will be able to translate all supported languages. If the model cannot recognize the language in some text fragments, then you will be returned a document with these untranslated fragments and with the rest of the text translated.

The following code example shows how to use the *Gemini 1.5 Flash* model in Aspose.Words to translate a document into Arabic:

{{< highlight cpp >}}
void AiTranslate()
{
    auto doc = MakeObject<Document>(MyDir + u"Document.docx");

    SharedPtr<IAiModelText> model = System::ExplicitCast<GoogleAiModel>(MakeObject<AiModel>()->Create(AiModelType::Gpt4OMini)->WithApiKey(u"API_KEY"));

    auto translatedDoc = model->Translate(doc, Language::Arabic);
    translatedDoc->Save(ArtifactsDir + u"AI.AiTranslate.docx");
}
{{< /highlight >}}

Translating documents with Aspose.Words saves time and makes it easy to integrate translation functionality into your projects. For more information, check the [Aspose.Words.AI](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.ai/) API documentation.

## FAQ

1. **Q:** Which languages can I translate a document into with Aspose.Words AI?  
   **A:** The `Translate` method supports any language defined in the `Aspose.Words.AI::Language` enumeration, which currently includes more than 300 languages provided by Google generative models.

2. **Q:** Do I need a Google API key to use the `Translate` method?  
   **A:** Yes. When creating a `GoogleAiModel` you must supply a valid Google Cloud API key via `WithApiKey`. The key authorizes calls to the underlying Google AI service.

3. **Q:** How does the `Translate` method handle documents that contain multiple source languages?  
   **A:** The AI model automatically detects the language of each text fragment. It translates each fragment to the target language independently, so mixed‑language source documents are fully supported.

4. **Q:** What happens if the AI model cannot recognize the language of a text fragment?  
   **A:** Unrecognizable fragments are left unchanged in the output document, while all other recognizable text is translated. This allows you to identify and handle those fragments manually if needed.

5. **Q:** Can I use a different AI model (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro) for translation?  
   **A:** Yes. Replace `AiModelType::Gpt4OMini` with the desired model type, such as `AiModelType::Gemini15Pro`, when creating the `AiModel`. The rest of the code remains the same.
