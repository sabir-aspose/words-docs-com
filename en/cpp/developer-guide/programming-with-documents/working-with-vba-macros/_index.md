Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) for Microsoft Word is a simple but powerful programming language that can be used to extend the functionality. Aspose.Words API provides three classes to get access to the VBA project source code:

- The [VBAProject](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.vba/vbaproject/) class provides access to VBA project information
- The [VBAModulesCollection](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.vba/vbamodulecollection/) class returns the collection of VBA project modules
- The [VbaModule](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.vba/vbamodule/) class provides access to the VBA project module

## Create a VBA Project

Aspose.Words API provides `Document.VbaProject` property to get or set VbaProject in the document.

The following code example demonstrates how to create a VBA project and VBA Module along with basic properties e.g. Name and Type:

## Read Macros

Aspose.Words also provides users with the ability to read VBA macros.

The following code example shows how to read VBA Macros from the document:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "d55d8631947d283b1f0da99afa06c492" "cpp-Loading-and-Saving-WorkingWithVbaMacros-ReadVbaMacros.cpp" >}}

## Write or Modify Macros

Using Aspose.Words, users can modify VBA macros.

The following code example shows how to modify VBA Macros using the [SourceCode](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.vba/vbamodule/get_sourcecode/) property:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "d55d8631947d283b1f0da99afa06c492" "cpp-Loading-and-Saving-WorkingWithVbaMacros-ModifyVbaMacros.cpp" >}}

## Clone VBA Project

With Aspose.Words it is also possible to clone VBA projects.

The following code example shows how to clone the VBA Project using the [Clone](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.vba/vbamodule/clone/) property which creates a copy of the existing project:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "d55d8631947d283b1f0da99afa06c492" "cpp-Loading-and-Saving-WorkingWithVbaMacros-CloneVbaProject.cpp" >}}

## Clone VBA Module

You can also clone VBA modules if needed.

The following code example shows how to clone the VBA Module using the [Clone](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.vba/vbamodule/clone/) property which creates a copy of the existing project:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "d55d8631947d283b1f0da99afa06c492" "cpp-Loading-and-Saving-WorkingWithVbaMacros-CloneVbaModule.cpp" >}}

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How do I apply an Aspose.Words license when working with VBA macros in C++?  
   **A:** Load the license file using `Aspose::Words::License license; license.SetLicense("Aspose.Words.CPP.lic");` before creating any `Document` objects. The license covers all features, including VBA project access, so the API will work without evaluation limitations.

2. **Q:** Can I clone an entire VBA project from one document to another?  
   **A:** Yes. Retrieve the source project's `VbaProject` via `Document sourceDoc; sourceDoc.VbaProject;`, then assign it to the target document with `targetDoc.VbaProject = sourceDoc.VbaProject->Clone();`. This creates a deep copy of the project and all its modules.

3. **Q:** How can I read the source code of a specific VBA macro module?  
   **A:** Access the module through the collection: `VbaModule* module = doc.VbaProject->Modules->GetByName("Module1");` and then read the code with `String code = module->GetSourceCode();`. The returned string contains the full VBA source.

4. **Q:** Is it possible to modify a VBA macro’s source code and save the changes back to the document?  
   **A:** Yes. After obtaining the `VbaModule`, call `module->SetSourceCode(newCode);` where `newCode` is a `String` containing the updated VBA code. Save the document afterwards to persist the changes.

5. **Q:** Are there any limitations when manipulating VBA macros with Aspose.Words for C++?  
   **A:** The API supports reading, writing, cloning, and deleting VBA projects and modules, but it does not execute VBA code. Also, certain protected or encrypted VBA projects may require the appropriate password to be set via `VbaProject->Password`. Ensure the document is not password‑protected for VBA unless you provide the password.
