In Aspose.Words, the [TextBox](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.drawing/textbox/) class is used to specify how text is displayed inside a shape. It exposes a public property named **Parent** to get the parent shape for the text box so that the customer can find the linked [Shape](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.drawing/shape/) from the associated **TextBox**.

## Create A Link

The **TextBox** class provides [IsValidLinkTarget](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.drawing/textbox/isvalidlinktarget/) method in order to check whether the**TextBox** can be linked to the target **Textbox**.

The following code example shows how to check if the `TextBox` can be linked to the target Textbox:

## Check TextBox Sequence

There are several ways to display text in a shape. The [TextBox](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.drawing/shape/get_textbox/) can be the Head, Middle, or Tail of a sequence.

The following code example shows how to checkif **TextBox** is a Head, Tail, or Middle of the sequence:

## Break a Link

Using the [BreakForwardLink](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/aspose.words.drawing/textbox/breakforwardlink/) method you can break the link to the next **TextBox**.

The following code example shows how to break a link for a **TextBox**:

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How can I verify that one TextBox can be linked to another TextBox?  
   **A:** Use the `TextBox::IsValidLinkTarget` method. Pass the target `TextBox` instance to this method; it returns `true` if the link is allowed, otherwise `false`. This check prevents linking incompatible text boxes.

2. **Q:** How do I determine whether a TextBox is the head, middle, or tail of a linked sequence?  
   **A:** The `TextBox` class provides the properties `IsHead`, `IsMiddle`, and `IsTail`. Inspect these boolean properties to know the position of the current TextBox within the linked chain.

3. **Q:** What is the correct way to break an existing forward link from a TextBox?  
   **A:** Call the `BreakForwardLink()` method on the `TextBox` you want to detach. This removes the link to the next TextBox while leaving the rest of the chain intact.

4. **Q:** How can I obtain the Shape that contains a given TextBox?  
   **A:** Use the `Parent` property of the `TextBox`. It returns a pointer to the owning `Shape` object, allowing you to access shape‑level properties such as position, size, or fill.

5. **Q:** How do I link two TextBoxes together programmatically?  
   **A:** After confirming the link is valid with `IsValidLinkTarget`, assign the target TextBox to the source using `SetLinkTarget`. Example:  

   ```cpp
   Aspose::Words::Drawing::TextBox* sourceBox = sourceShape->GetTextBox();
   Aspose::Words::Drawing::TextBox* targetBox = targetShape->GetTextBox();

   if (sourceBox->IsValidLinkTarget(targetBox))
   {
       sourceBox->SetLinkTarget(targetBox);
   }
   ```  

   This creates a forward link from `sourceBox` to `targetBox`.
