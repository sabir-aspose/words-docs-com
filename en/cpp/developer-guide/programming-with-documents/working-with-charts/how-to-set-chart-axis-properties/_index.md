If you want to work with chart axis, scaling, and display units for the value axis, please use [ChartAxis](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.drawing.charts.chart_axis), [AxisDisplayUnit](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.drawing.charts.axis_display_unit), and [AxisScaling](https://reference.aspose.com/words/cpp/class/aspose.words.drawing.charts.axis_scaling) classes.

The following code example shows how to define X and Y‑axis properties:

## How to Set Date‑Time Value of Axis

The following code example shows how to set date/time values to axis properties:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "d55d8631947d283b1f0da99afa06c492" "cpp-Programming-Documents-Charts-WorkingWithChartAxis-SetDateTimeValuesToAxis.cpp" >}}

## How to Format Number Value of Axis

The following code example shows how to change the format of numbers on the value axis:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "d55d8631947d283b1f0da99afa06c492" "cpp-Programming-Documents-Charts-WorkingWithChartAxis-SetNumberFormatForAxis.cpp" >}}

## How to Set Bounds of Axis

The `AxisBound` class represents a minimum or maximum bound of axis values. Bound can be specified as a numeric, date‑time or a special "auto" value.

The following code example shows how to set the bounds of an axis:

## How to Set Interval Unit Between Labels

The following code example shows how to set the interval unit between labels on an axis:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "d55d8631947d283b1f0da99afa06c492" "cpp-Programming-Documents-Charts-WorkingWithChartAxis-SetIntervalUnitBetweenLabelsOnAxis.cpp" >}}

## How to Hide Chart Axis

If you want to show or hide the chart axis, you can simply achieve this by setting the value of the set_Hidden property.

The following code example shows how to hide the Y‑axis of the chart:

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "d55d8631947d283b1f0da99afa06c492" "cpp-Programming-Documents-Charts-WorkingWithChartAxis-HideChartAxis.cpp" >}}

## How to Align Chart Label

If you want to set a text alignment for multi‑line labels, you can simply achieve this by setting the value of the **TickLabelAlignment** property. The following code example shows how to tick label alignment.

{{< gist "aspose-words-gists" "d55d8631947d283b1f0da99afa06c492" "cpp-Programming-Documents-Charts-WorkingWithChartAxis-TickMultiLineLabelAlignment.cpp" >}}

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How can I set date‑time values on a chart axis?  
   **A:** Use the `AxisScaling` class to assign an array of `System::DateTime` values to the axis. Set the axis type to `AxisType::DateTime` and optionally define the major unit and base unit to control the spacing of the labels.

2. **Q:** How do I change the number format displayed on the value axis?  
   **A:** Create an `AxisDisplayUnit` object and assign it to the axis via `ChartAxis::set_DisplayUnit`. Then call `AxisScaling::set_NumberFormat` with a format string such as `"#,##0.00"` to control how numbers are rendered.

3. **Q:** How can I hide a specific axis in a chart?  
   **A:** Set the `Hidden` property of the desired `ChartAxis` to `true` (e.g., `chart->get_Axes()->get_Y()->set_Hidden(true);`). The axis will no longer be drawn, but its data remains available for calculations.

4. **Q:** How do I set custom minimum and maximum bounds for an axis?  
   **A:** Use the `AxisBound` class to create lower and upper bounds. Assign them to the axis with `AxisScaling::set_Minimum` and `AxisScaling::set_Maximum`. You can pass a numeric value, a `DateTime`, or `AxisBound::Auto` for automatic scaling.

5. **Q:** How can I align multi‑line tick labels on an axis?  
   **A:** Set the `TickLabelAlignment` property of the `ChartAxis` to one of the `ParagraphAlignment` values (e.g., `ParagraphAlignment::Center`). This aligns each line of the label according to the chosen alignment.
