The main reason to protect or encrypt a document is to apply more control over who can access the document or who can edit it. Applying protection to your documents, you avoid common risks such as copying or modifying documents without permission, as well as data leakage.

Some of the most popular formats when working with documents are Microsoft Word formats or formats that can be exported from Word. That's why many users are interested in the same document protection options that Microsoft Word provides. Despite the complexity of these options, Aspose.Words supports most of them, so it makes it an excellent solution for working with documents.

This article describes what options Aspose.Words provides for document protection and how these options are presented in the familiar Microsoft Word user interface. In the child articles of the current section, you can learn more about the listed protection functions with all the necessary properties and methods.

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How can I encrypt a Word document with a password using Aspose.Words for C++?  
   **A:** Load the document, call `Protect` with the `ReadOnly` protection type and provide the opening password, then save the file. Example:  

   ```cpp
   System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Aspose::Words::Document>(u"input.docx");
   doc->Protect(Aspose::Words::Protection::ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"", u"MyOpenPassword");
   doc->Save(u"encrypted.docx");
   ```

2. **Q:** How do I make a document read‑only without requiring a password?  
   **A:** Use the `Protect` method with the `ReadOnly` protection type and pass an empty string for the password. The document can be opened by anyone but cannot be edited.  

   ```cpp
   System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Aspose::Words::Document>(u"input.docx");
   doc->Protect(Aspose::Words::Protection::ProtectionType::ReadOnly, u"", u"");
   doc->Save(u"readonly.docx");
   ```

3. **Q:** How can I restrict editing to comments or tracked changes only?  
   **A:** Choose the appropriate `ProtectionType`—`Comments` or `TrackedChanges`—when calling `Protect`. This limits the user to adding comments or using tracked changes, respectively.  

   ```cpp
   // Restrict to comments only
   doc->Protect(Aspose::Words::Protection::ProtectionType::Comments, u"", u"");
   // Restrict to tracked changes only
   doc->Protect(Aspose::Words::Protection::ProtectionType::TrackedChanges, u"", u"");
   ```

4. **Q:** How do I add a digital signature to a document with Aspose.Words for C++?  
   **A:** Use `DigitalSignatureUtil::Sign`, providing the document, the path to a PKCS#12 certificate, and the certificate password.  

   ```cpp
   System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::Document> doc = System::MakeObject<Aspose::Words::Document>(u"input.docx");
   Aspose::Words::DigitalSignatureUtil::Sign(doc, u"mycert.pfx", u"certPassword");
   doc->Save(u"signed.docx");
   ```

5. **Q:** How can I apply a license to remove evaluation limitations?  
   **A:** Create a `License` object and call `SetLicense` with the path to your `.lic` file before using any Aspose.Words functionality.  

   ```cpp
   System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::License> license = System::MakeObject<Aspose::Words::License>();
   license->SetLicense(u"Aspose.Words.CPP.lic");
   // Now the library works in licensed mode
   ```
