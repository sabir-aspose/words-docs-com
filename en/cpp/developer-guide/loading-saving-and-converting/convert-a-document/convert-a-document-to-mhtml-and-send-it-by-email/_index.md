Aspose.Words can convert any document to the MHTML (Web Archive) format. This makes it convenient to use Aspose.Words and `Aspose.Email` together. You can load a predefined document in any supported format, such as DOC, OOXML, or RTF, into Aspose.Words, fill it with data, save the resulting document as MHTML, and then send it by e‑mail using `Aspose.Email`.

The following code example shows how to convert any document to MHTML and send it by email:

## FAQ

1. **Q: Which input document formats can be converted to MHTML?**  
   **A:** Aspose.Words for C++ supports all formats that the library can load, including DOC, DOCX, OOXML, RTF, HTML, EPUB, and many others. Any document that can be opened with `Aspose::Words::Document` can be saved as MHTML using the `Save` method with `SaveFormat::Mhtml`.

2. **Q: Do I need a separate license for Aspose.Email when sending the MHTML file?**  
   **A:** Yes. Converting the document to MHTML uses Aspose.Words, while sending the e‑mail uses Aspose.Email. Both products require their own valid licenses. Apply each license before using the corresponding API (e.g., `Aspose::Words::License` for Words and `Aspose::Email::License` for Email).

3. **Q: How can I set the e‑mail subject, body, and attachment programmatically in C++?**  
   **A:** Use the `Aspose::Email::MailMessage` class. Create a `MailMessage`, set `Subject` and `Body`, then add the MHTML file as an attachment with `MailMessage::Attachments->Add`. Finally, send the message with `SmtpClient`. Example:

   ```cpp
   System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Email::MailMessage> msg = System::MakeObject<Aspose::Email::MailMessage>();
   msg->set_Subject(u"Converted Document");
   msg->set_Body(u"Please find the converted MHTML document attached.");
   msg->get_Attachments()->Add(System::MakeObject<Aspose::Email::Attachment>(u"document.mhtml"));
   ```

4. **Q: Can I embed images in the MHTML output so they appear correctly in the e‑mail?**  
   **A:** Yes. When saving to MHTML, Aspose.Words automatically embeds all images as base‑64 data URIs inside the file. The resulting MHTML can be opened directly in a browser or attached to an e‑mail without additional handling.

5. **Q: What should I do if the conversion throws an “Unsupported file format” exception?**  
   **A:** Verify that the source file's extension matches a format supported by Aspose.Words and that the file is not corrupted. If the file is in a proprietary format, consider converting it to a supported format (e.g., DOCX) before loading it with Aspose.Words. Also ensure you are using the latest version of the library, as newer releases add support for additional formats.
