## FAQ

1. **Q:** Which operating systems can I run Aspose.Words for C++ on?  
   **A:** The library supports 64‑bit and 32‑bit versions of Windows (2008 Server through Windows 10), major Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE, CentOS, and macOS 12.0 or later for both x86_64 and arm64 architectures.

2. **Q:** Do I need Microsoft Word or any other Office product installed on the target machine?  
   **A:** No. Aspose.Words for C++ is a self‑contained engine and does not rely on Microsoft Word, Office, or any other third‑party Office component.

3. **Q:** What extra packages must be installed on Linux or macOS before using the library?  
   **A:** Both platforms require the **fontconfig** library (runtime binaries and tools). On Linux install `libfontconfig` via the package manager (`apt`, `yum`, etc.). On macOS install it with Homebrew: `brew install fontconfig`.

4. **Q:** Which compilers and language standards are required for building on Linux?  
   **A:** The library requires a compiler that supports the C++14 standard. Currently, Clang 3.9.1 or later is officially supported. Any compiler meeting C++14 compliance can be used, but Clang is the recommended choice.

5. **Q:** How do I apply a license for Aspose.Words for C++?  
   **A:** Create an instance of `Aspose::Words::License`, then call its `SetLicense` method with the path to your `.lic` file, e.g.:  

   ```cpp
   Aspose::Words::License* license = new Aspose::Words::License();
   license->SetLicense(u"myLicenseFile.lic");
   ```  

   The license must be loaded before any document processing operations to enable the licensed features.
