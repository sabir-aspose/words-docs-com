To become more familiar with the Aspose.Words possibilities and features we provide examples that can be downloaded from our GitHub repository, run, and learn in detail.

In this article, you can find the system requirements, as well as information on how to run the examples.

## Windows with Nuget Package

### Software Requirements and Prerequisites

Please make sure you meet the following requirements before downloading and running the examples:

1. Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio 2022.
2. Installed NuGet Package Manager and the latest NuGet API version for Visual Studio. (optional)
3. Selected **nuget.org** option in the “Tools → Options" dialog box under "NuGet Package Manager → Package Sources”.
4. An active Internet connection to use the `NuGet` Automatic Package Restore feature in the Examples project. If you do not have an active Internet connection on the machine where the examples are to be executed follow the directions from Windows with Cmake Package.

### Download and Run the Examples

All Aspose.Words for C++ examples are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/aspose-words/Aspose.Words-for-C). You can either clone the repository using your favorite GitHub client or download [the ZIP file](https://github.com/aspose-words/Aspose.Words-for-C/tree/master/Examples).

After getting a copy of the repository, you may find that:

- All the examples are located in the **Examples** folder.
- There are Visual Studio solution files for C++ created in Visual Studio 2022.

To run the examples, open the solution file in Visual Studio and build the project:

- For **API Reference** examples, the structure is based on class names, for **Docs** examples it is mostly based on the [Developer Guiled](/words/cpp/developer-guide/) documentation section.
- On the first run, the dependencies will be automatically downloaded via NuGet.
- The **Data** folder at the root folder of **Examples** contains input files that were used in the examples.
- All examples can be run as unit tests.

## Windows with CMake Package

### Software Requirements and Prerequisites

Please make sure you meet the following requirements before downloading and running the examples:

1. Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio 2022.
2. [Cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) >= 3.16.0
3. Download lastest CMake Package from https://downloads.aspose.com/words/cpp

### Download and Run the Examples

All Aspose.Words for C++ examples are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/aspose-words/Aspose.Words-for-C). You can either clone the repository using your favorite GitHub client or download [the ZIP file](https://github.com/aspose-words/Aspose.Words-for-C/tree/master/Examples).

Place folders `Aspose.Words.Cpp` and `CodePorting.Native.Cs2Cpp_*`  in the root of a copy of the repository.

All the examples are located in the **Examples** folder.

To run the examples run the following commands from the root of a copy of the repository:
{{< highlight bash >}}
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -Thost=x64 -Ax64 -S Examples\DocsExamples\ -B Examples\DocsExamples\build
{{< /highlight >}}

The solution for Visual Studio will be generated in the `Examples\DocsExamples\build`

To run the examples, open the solution file in Visual Studio and build the project:

- For **API Reference** examples, the structure is based on class names, for **Docs** examples it is mostly based on the [Developer Guiled](/words/cpp/developer-guide/) documentation section.
- The **Data** folder at the root folder of **Examples** contains input files that were used in the examples.
- All examples can be run as unit tests.

## Linux

### Software Requirements and Prerequisites

Please make sure you meet the following requirements before downloading and running the examples:

1. CLang >= 3.9.1 
2. [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)
3. [Cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) >= 3.16.0
4. Download lastest CMake Package from https://downloads.aspose.com/words/cpp

## FAQ

1. **Q:** How can I run the examples on a machine without Internet access?  
   **A:** Download the CMake package from the Aspose download site and place the `Aspose.Words.Cpp` and `CodePorting.Native.Cs2Cpp_*` folders in the repository root before building. All required binaries are then available locally, so NuGet restore is not needed.

2. **Q:** Do I need to apply a license to run the example projects?  
   **A:** The examples work without a license but will add a watermark to generated documents. To remove the watermark, place a valid `Aspose.Words.Cpp` license file (e.g., `License.txt`) in the executable’s working directory and call `Aspose::Words::License license; license.SetLicense("License.txt");` at the start of your program.

3. **Q:** Which version of Visual Studio is required for the NuGet‑based examples?  
   **A:** Visual Studio 2022 (or later) is required because the examples target the C++20 standard and rely on the latest MSVC toolset that ships with VS 2022.

4. **Q:** How do I build and run the Linux examples using CMake?  
   **A:** After installing Clang, Ninja, and CMake (≥ 3.16), execute the commands shown in the Linux section: configure with `cmake -S Examples/DocsExamples -B Examples/DocsExamples/build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`, build with `cmake --build Examples/DocsExamples/build`, and run the tests with `cmake -E chdir Examples/DocsExamples/build ctest --verbose`.

5. **Q:** Can I run the example projects as unit tests from the command line?  
   **A:** Yes. After building the solution, navigate to the `build` directory and execute `ctest --verbose` (Linux/macOS) or run the generated test runner executable (Windows). This will execute all example unit tests and display their results.
